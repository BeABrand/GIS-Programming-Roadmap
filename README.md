## Intro
This repository compiles resources that will take a motivated user from GIS noob to a proficient GIS Developer. The wiki articles are organized by programming language and broken down by subcategories and skill levels. This was highly inspired by [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#introduction-to-computer-science)

Resources mostly come from highly effective and free cources as well as blog posts and tutorials. There is a mixture of proprietary (ESRI) and open-source materials.

Please feel free to contribute and correct any errors that I inevitably will make.
