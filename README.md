# Definitive-Guide-to-GIS-Programming

**Under development**

This repository compiles resources that will take a motivated user from GIS noob to a proficient GIS Developer. The wiki articles are organized by programming language and broken down by subcategories and skill levels.

Resources mostly come from highly effective and free cources as well as blog posts and tutorials. There is a mixture of proprietary (ESRI) and open-source materials.

Please feel free to contribute and correct any errors that I inevitably will make.
