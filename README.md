## Intro
This repository compiles resources that will take a motivated user from GIS noob to a proficient GIS Developer. The wiki articles are organized by programming language and broken down by subcategories and skill levels. This was highly inspired by [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#introduction-to-computer-science)

Resources mostly come from highly effective and free cources as well as blog posts and tutorials. There is a mixture of proprietary (ESRI) and open-source materials.

Please feel free to contribute and correct any errors that I inevitably will make.

## GIS Fundamentals

If you've taken an intro to GIS course or used GIS in the workplace for more than a few months, skip this section. Otherwise, let's review some materials to make sure we have a basic understanding of what GIS is, what common GIS tasks are, and what GIS tools exist out there.

Choose one of desktop softwares below and run through the associated course to get up to speed. This will take about 40 hours and will give you a great foundation in GIS. 

##### ArcMap / ArcPro
ArcMap and ArcPro are proprietary desktop software for performing GIS analysis distributed by ESRI. These are the most widely used in the industry and learning them is the safest bet at dipping your feet into the industry. Getting to Know ArcPro comes with a free one-year ArcPro license and is well worth the money if you are serious about entering the field. If you take an intro to GIS course through a college, chances are you'll run through this book as a majority of your course work.

##### QGIS
The most commonly used open source desktop software. It is free to download and has a wide array of plugins that let you do just about anything with GIS.
